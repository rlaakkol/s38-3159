Client behind NAT
- Rendezvous
	- Need to signal server address to client(s)
		- Mechanism: DNS, Dynamic DNS, static configuration, etc.

- Connection establishment
	- Client
		- Selects random source port
		- Sends message to server from this port
		- Listens for replies on the sending port
	- Server
		- Listens predefined port
		- Receives message from client and replies to same port
		- Needs to send reply from the source address to which the client sent the message

- Keep-alive
	- Server -> client: send keep-alive messages
	- Client -> server: reply to keep-alive messages 
	- Sent every 10 seconds

Server and client behind NAT
- Rendezvous
	- Well-known rendezvous server
	- Server registers itself to rendezvous server
		- Sends its own IP, STUN IP to rendezvous server which allocates TURN IP
	- Client can query server from rendezvous server using some identifier
		- Receives ordered list of server IPs
		- Mutual authentication?

- Connection establishment
	- Client
		- Client tries to subscribe to server using received IPs
		- Add session ID to enable simultaneous subscription attempts
	- Server
		- Similar to first case

- Keep-alive
	- Similar to first case
	- Server
		- Needs to maintain registration to rendezvous server

Optimizations
- Two-way negotiation fro subscribe and publish
	- Precondition: client has relaxed NAT
