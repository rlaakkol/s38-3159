* subscribe full state sync
   * subscribe:                -> all
   * subscribe: []                -> none
   * subscribe: [ … ]        -> update list of subscriptions
* server timeouts sensor updates
   * maximum interval = ???
      * 60s?
* implementation
   * python3 + event
* notify
   * only maintain latest state
   * idempotent

2014-01-28
* prototype
* fixed-length bit header with jsonish payload
* unreliable in-order delivery of idempotent state

2014-01-29
* writing out the doc
* discussing protocol details
        
2014-01-30
   * discussed protocol details (server & client timeouts and unsubscribing)

2014-02-03
   * discussed further details about specification and continued writing 
   the specification
2014-02-07
   * Implement protocol encoding

2014-02-09
   * Fix handling of quoted binary data in jsonish
   * Implement server’s client state, with recvseq handling and sending acks
   * Implement client state, with sendseq handling and receiving acks 
   with retransmit timeouts
2014-02-26
   * Designed prototype NAT discovery behaviour
2014-02-27
   * Discussed implications of new ambient noise sensor
   * Discussed implications of aggregation features
   * Discussed design of aggregation features
   * pepeightified code
2014-03-04
   * ASD(F): does not really change anything
   * TODO: test perf of server in scenario Z
   * Aggregation should not require changes to packet format, only SUBSCRIBE 
   JSON payload changes syntax
   * non-aggregated subscriptions are a special-case of the aggregation syntax
   * Do all aggregations queries include some given interval?
   * Changes to publish response
   * drop data_size
   * list of sensor-dicts?
   * Optional handshaking for available aggregation methods, which are 
   sensor(type?)-specific
   * Flags
   * Non-acknowledgement flag
   * Compression flag for gzipping payload
2014-03-07
   * Discussed aggregation message format
   * JSON based
   * Discussed protocol security
   * DDos attacks are a major threat
2014-03-10
   * Drop teardown timeout
   * Touchup docs
2014-03-25
   * Version 2 encoding, bcompat
   * compression
   * logging
