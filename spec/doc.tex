\section{Introduction}
This document describes a UDP-based protocol for use in a client-server based publish-subscribe model.
The server receives sensor updates, and publishes the sensor values to subscribed clients.
Individual clients may query for the list of available sensors, and update their set of subscribed sensors.
The server will monitor sensor availability, and update the client when sensors become available or unavailable.
The protocol is designed for real-time purposes, and as such, provides ordered unreliable transmission, periodically transmitting the newest state.

The bidirectional control streams are identified by a type code and separate sequence counters for client and server transmissions, which are acknowledged by the recipient.
The subscription protocol is based on the use of soft state, with the client and server transmitting their full subscription state on each change.
It is expected that the amount of subscription-related traffic will remain minor compared to the actual \textbf{publish}-traffic.

The unidirectional data stream is used by the server to publish the most recent sensor values to the client.
The client will periodically acknowledge the received sensor publishes, which is used by the server as a feedback channel for keepalive and congestion control purposes.
It is vitally important for the server to handle clients that disappear, timing out their subscriptions.

The messages are transmitted as UDP packets between the client and server, using a fixed port on the server, and an arbitrary port on the client.
All messages are transmitted and received using the same pair of addresses/ports.
If the client changes to a different address, it must create a new subscription to the server, and the previous one will time out.

\section{Message format}
The protocol is based on a hybrid binary/text encoding, using a fixed-size binary header for transport control purposes, and a JSON-encoded variable-length payload.

The message header format is described in Figure \ref{fig:header}. The 
Magic-field is an identifier for our protocol and also works as a version
number. The Type-field denotes the message type (subscribe, unsubscribe, etc.)
and the A-field denotes the \textit{ackthis} bit. The remaining bits are reserved for future use. 
The following fields are for sequence numbers: \textbf{Ack-Seq} is used for acknowledging receiver 
sequence numbers, and \textbf{Seq} is used for the sender sequence number.

Below is a list of the various message variants and their semantics:
\begin{description}
	\item[subscribe-query] Client initiated query of the available 
	sensors. The server sends the sensor list and the client processes it.
    
	\item[subscribe-queryresponse] Response from the server to 
	\emph{subscribe-query}, contains a list of available sensor names. 
    The payload must have the following format: \verb|["sensor1", "sensor2",...]|.
    
	\item[subscribe-request] A message sent by the client to update its sensor
	subscription. Contains a list of the sensors to which the client wants to
	subscribe. This message must be acknowledged by the server. If the client
    wants to subscribe to one or more sensors, the payload must be a list with
    the sensor names: \verb|["sensor1","sensor2",...]|. If the client wants
    to subscribe to all sensors, the payload must be \verb|true|. Unsubscribing,
    that is, subscribing to no sensors is done by sending an empty list. The
    payload must thus be \verb|[]|.
    
	\item[subscribe-response] Server acknowledgement to the 
	\emph{subsribe-request} message. The message contains a dictionary which
    contains all the sensors and separately specifies the subscribed sensors.
    A subscribed sensor has the dictionary value of \verb|true| and an unsubcribed
    has the value \verb|false|. Thus the payload must have the following format:
    \\ \verb|{"sensor1":false,"sensor2":false,"sensor3":true,...}|.
    
	\item[subscribe-update] A message from the server containing an updated
	list of sensors. This message is sent whenever the sensors are updated,
	that is, a sensor is added or removed. This message needs to be acknowledged 
	by the client and is sent until an acknowledgement is received. The payload
    must have the same format as the \emph{subscribe-response} message.
    
	\item[subscribe-ack] Client initiated message which acknowledges the 
	\emph{subscribe-update} message.
    
	\item[publish] The server-initiated message contains the values of
	the subscribed sensors. If this message is lost, it is not retransmitted but
	new values are sent instead. The payload is a list with the sensor values 
    (dictionary) from each sensor, an example: \verb|[{...},{...}]|.
    
	\item[publish (/w ackthis)] Like the "normal" \emph{publish} message
	but this must be acknowledged by the client. The acknowledgement is used
	by the server to check whether the other party is still	available, and measure
    congestion. This message has the same payload format as the unacknowledged
    \emph{publish} message.
    
	\item[publish-ack] Message from the client which acknowledges the previous
	\emph{publish (/w ackthis)} message.
    
	\item[teardown] A message sent by the client indicating that is 
	wants to end the communication with the server. This message must be 
	acknowledged by the server. A client sends this message until it receives 
	the \emph{teardown-ack} message as an acknowledgement. If the server 
	receives this message from an unknown client, it will respond with a
	\emph{teardown-ack} message.
    
	\item[teardown-ack] Server response to the \emph{teardown} message
	sent by a client. After sending this message, the server timeouts for $T_t$
    seconds, and if no retransmits of \emph{teardown} arrive, the connection is
    terminated and resources are freed.
\end{description}

The \emph{subscribe-*} messages have a timer mechanism.
When a message is sent with an incremented sequence number, the timer is set.
Receiving a message with the matching \emph{type} and \emph{ack-seq} field will clear the timer.
If the timer expires after $T$ seconds, the previously sent message will be retransmitted (using the same seq).
Handling of received messages is based on the \emph{seq} field.
The highest received \emph{seq} is recorded, acked and processed.
A duplicate \emph{seq} corresponding to the updated seq is considered a duplicate, and is acked without being processed.
A lower \emph{seq} than recorded indicates packet reordering and is dropped.

\section{Protocol description}
\subsection{Subscribing and unsubscribing}
When a client wants to subscribe to some sensors it will start by sending a 
\emph{subscribe-query} message to the server. The server will then reply with
a \emph{subscribe-queryresponse} message, which contains the list of currently
available sensors. The client subscribes and unsubscribes to sensors by sending a 
\emph{subscribe-request} message, which contains a list of sensors to which 
the client wants to subscribe. The server will then respond with the
\emph{subscribe-response} which contains the sensors to which the client is
subscribed. Finally, the client responds to the previous message with the 
\emph{subscribe-ack} message to acknowledge its reception of the message.
A normal sequence of message sent when a client subscribes to some sensors
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sub_normal}. The same sequence with lost packets 
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sub_lost}.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/subscribe_lost.pdf}
    \caption{A subscription sequence with packet loss.}
    \label{fig:sub_lost}
\end{figure}

\newpage

When the available sensors change, the server will send a new list of sensors
to the clients with the \emph{subscribe-update} message. The client will
acknowledge the reception by sending the \emph{subscribe-ack} message. If the
client now wants to change its subscription, it may send a new 
\emph{subscribe-request} message with a new sensor list, which may contain any arbitrary subset or superset of the previous subscription sensor set, including an empty set to unsubscribe from all sensors.

A client terminates the connection by sending the \emph{teardown} message to the
server. It expects a response from the server and continues sending the same
message until a response is received. The server responds by sending a
\emph{teardown-ack} message and waits for timeout $T_t$ for retransmits of the \emph{teardown} message. If no retransmits arrive, the server may release its resources
related to the client. If the server receives a \emph{teardown} from a client that has no resources currently allocated for it, the server only responds with the \emph{teardown-ack}

\subsection{Publish}
Whenever a new sensor value is received at the server it will be sent to the 
clients who are subscribed to the selected sensor. The updates are sent with
the \emph{publish} message, which contains the current value of the sensor.
These messages are not retransmitted and generally not acknowledged, except in the case of the on/off -type). Publish
messages with the "ackthis" bit are sent every $T_s$ seconds even if there
is no sensor data to publish. The payload of these messages are last states
of the subscribed on/off sensors. These messages must be acknowledged by the client 
with the \emph{publish-ack} message, but the server may continue sending normal \emph{publish} messages without waiting for the ack to arrive. A publish message
sequence is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pub_normal}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/publish_normal.pdf}
    \caption{A publish message sequence.}
    \label{fig:pub_normal}
\end{figure}

The purpose of these messages is to act as a "keepalive" mechanism (and also double
as a reliability mechanism for the on/off sensors). If acknowledgements from a client
are not received within a time of $N \cdot T_s$ seconds for some value of $N$, the 
server will timeout the client. The same mechanism also works in the opposite 
direction, if publish messages are not received from the server within 
$M \cdot T_s$ seconds for some value of $M$,
the server is considered to be unavailable and the client will time out. The time it takes for an acknowledgement to be received after the sending of
a publish message is used to estimate the RTT.
The \emph{publish-ack} message sent by the client includes both the number of messages sent by the server (\emph{ack-seq}) as well as the number of publish messages received by the client (\emph{seq}).
The server may use this information to determine packet loss for congestion control purposes.

\subsection{Payload format}
\label{payload-format}

The message payload is a JSON-formatted object.

The JSON values \texttt{false}, \texttt{0}, \texttt{[]} and \texttt{\{\}} are defined to evaluate to boolean false.

\subsubsection{\emph{subscribe-request}}
The \emph{subsribe-request} message contains either a boolean value, a list of sensor names, or a dict of sensor names and complex aggregation subscriptions.

To subscribe to all available sensors (including sensors becoming available in the future), the client may send a subscribe messsage containing a boolean:
\begin{verbatim}
true
\end{verbatim}

To subscribe to a set of sensors with non-aggregated publishes, the client may send a subscribe message containing:
\begin{verbatim}
[ 'temp:1', 'device:1' ]
\end{verbatim}

To subscribe to a set of sensors with complex aggregation rules, the client may send a subscribe message contaning an aggregation expression dict:
\begin{verbatim}
{ 'device:1': true, 'temp:1': { ... } }
\end{verbatim}

To unsubscribe from all sensors (while keeping the session open), the client may send a boolean false:
\begin{verbatim}
false
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{\emph{subscribe-response}}
The \emph{subribe-response} message contains a dict of sensor names and subscription state as an integer. A sensor that is actively subscribed to per request of the client will be given a positive state. A sensor that the client requested to subscribe to but is not available, or the client has unsubscribed from, is marked as zero. A sensor that the client attempted to subscribe to using an invalid aggregation expression is marked as negative.

\begin{verbatim}
{ 'temp:1': 1, 'temp:2': 0, 'camera:5': -1 }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{\emph{publish}}

The \emph{publish} message contains a dict of sensor names and their sensor values, encoded as a dict containing the sensor value, and timestamp, plus a sequence number for non-aggregated values.
\begin{verbatim}
{ 'device:1': { 'device': true,                     'seq_no': 36, 'ts': 1394197045.27 } }
{ 'device:1': { 'device': false,                    'seq_no': 36, 'ts': 1394197049.44 } }
{ 'gps:1':    { 'gps':    [ 60.182792, 24.796085 ], 'seq_no': 4,  'ts': 1394200030.25 } }
{ 'camera:1': { 'camera': false,                    'seq_no': 52, 'ts': 1394200084.55 } }
{ 'camera:1': { 'camera': '...',                    'seq_no': 51, 'ts': 1394200084.48 } }
{ 'asd:1':    { 'sound':  '...',                    'seq_no': 28, 'ts': 1394200191.92 } }
\end{verbatim}

The \emph{publish} message for an aggregated sensor will contain a list of such sensor-value dicts instead (indented for clarity):
\begin{verbatim}
{ 'temp:1': [
    { 'temp:1': -9.7,  'ts': 1394197037.09 },
    { 'temp:1': -9.8,  'ts': 1394197039.55 },
    { 'temp:1': -9.9,  'ts': 1394197041.72 },
    { 'temp:1': -9.10, 'ts': 1394197043.17 },
    { 'temp:1': -9.11, 'ts': 1394197045.27 }
] }
\end{verbatim}
